### Section 4.1.

1) Do you know if there is any good "visual" explanation of the graph Laplacian's spectrum and a graph Fourier transform?
2) What is the meaning of the chosen heat kernel in that section?

3) If we have a wavelet on a signal in time, it lives in the signal's frequency domain and in time (?)\
If we have a wavelet on an image, we would operate with a signal with frequences in one dimention of the image and their localization in another dimension of the image (?)\
If we have a wavelet on a graph, it lives in the spectral domain, but what is the "time" part of the wavelet in that case?

4) What is "scale $s$"? Is it that "time" thing? Is $s$ an integer given that we have it both in the heat kernel and in index? For example, in each $g()$, i.e. in $\Sigma_s=diag(g(s\lambda_1),....,)$?\
Connecting it to the Question 1), why "a nodeâ€™s neighborhoods can be adjusted by varying the scaling parameter $s$"?

5) We have $\psi_s=(\psi_{s,i}),~i=1...n$. So our "frequencies" are eigenvalues, so we have a wavelet component for each eigenvalue?...\
What is a wavelet, $\psi_{si}$ or $\psi_{s}$?\
What is a "mother wavelet" btw?\

6) $L = U\Lambda U^{-1}=U\Lambda U^T$ (since U is orthonormal?)\
Then, $\psi_s=U\Sigma_sU^T$.
Intuitively, I thought that $\Sigma_s$ a filter that we apply to the spectrum of a graph. But then I don't fully get what $\psi_s$ is.
Or do we just need $U$ to define anything that lies in the spectral domain of our graph??

7) Connected to Q 1), 6).\
If I have 2 graphs of, say, 8 and 15 nodes that share the same substructure, what would be the relation between their spectra?\
If I generated a wavelet with low s that is localized on that substructure, for each graph it will be defined through their spectra which are different.\
Then how do I keep the information that this wavelet is localized on the same substructure?

8)
